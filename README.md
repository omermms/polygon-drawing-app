## 🚀 Project Purpose

This application enables users to:

- Set the center coordinates (X, Y),
- Enter the number of edges and the length of each edge,
- Customize the color using RGB values,
- Rotate the polygon clockwise or counter-clockwise,
- Apply rotation by a given angle,
- View the vertex coordinates in text format.

## 📌 Notes

- RGB values must be between 0 and 255.
- Number of edges must be **between 3 and 10**.
- Maximum edge length is **10 units**.
- Pressing the RESET button draws a **random polygon**.
- On RESET, the center point may be randomly moved up to **3 units**.
- ROTATE works on the currently drawn shape.
